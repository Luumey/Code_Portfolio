The files here are snippets taken from "3D_Playformer_Player_Movement", 
they won't work on their own but I've tried to explain them best I can.

This project was made by a group of 6-8(depending on time) students over two months.

I was a programmer responcible mainly for the player character's movement mechanics and physics interaction.
